this repository contains a small demonstration of MySQL queries from java code

a set of sql files is included to create the database used in the example
and should be executed in the following order:

* create-database.sql
* create-db-user.sql

in MySQL Workbench or Command Line Interface, additionally the
<kbd>query-database.sql</kbd> file can be executed to see an example query and the
<kbd>delete-database.sql</kbd> file can be used to delete the database.
