# java-mysql-queries

this repository contains a small demonstration of MySQL queries from java code

the mysql-connector-java-5.1.37.jar file is included in the lib directory
and needs to be included to the classpath when compiling/running the code

a set of sql files is included to create the database used in the example
and should be executed in the following order:

* **create-database.sql**
* **create-db-user.sql**

in MySQL Workbench or the MySQL Command Line Interface, additionally the
**query-database.sql** file can be executed to see an example query and the
**delete-database.sql** file can be used to delete the database.
